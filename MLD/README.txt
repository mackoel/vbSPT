MLD: a simple maximum-likelihood estimator for camera-based single
particle tracking data with camera-based blur and localization errors
that are given for every point.

The code makes use of the routine triSym_d1Inv_trjWise.mex (source
code in HMMcore) to compute the determinant and some elements of the
inverse of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix.
